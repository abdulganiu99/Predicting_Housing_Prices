# Predicting California Housing Prices
A concise end-to-end machine learning project for predicting California housing prices to support economic planning and infrastructure development.

## Project goal
Produce accurate, explainable, and reproducible price forecasts for California housing at neighborhood/block-group level to inform:
- Economic planning and policy decisions
- Infrastructure and transit investment prioritization
- Affordable housing and zoning strategies

## Methods
- End-to-end pipeline: data ingestion & exploration  → cleaning → feature engineering → model training → evaluation → inference
- Baseline and production-ready models (linear, tree-based, gradient boosting)
- Spatial and socio-economic feature support
- Evaluation with standard regression metrics and uncertainty reporting
- Reproducible experiments and simple deployment examples

## Status: 
- in progress
